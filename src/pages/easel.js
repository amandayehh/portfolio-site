        <div className="p-main">
          In the U.S, there are over 20 social and emotional learning frameworks
          (SEL frameworks) that researchers, educators, and policymakers use to
          develop course curriculums, education policies, and testing. However,
          because each framework cover different cognitive domain, focus on
          different student groups, and emphasize different skills, it is
          difficult to choose the most suitable framework for each situation.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          As a designer at Friends of the Web, I collaborated with Harvard Easel
          Lab to design a framework research tool to help researchers,
          educators, and policymakers better understand and utilize SEL
          frameworks.

        <div className="h2">
          1. Frameworks cover different skills and domain
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          Some frameworks might focus more on leadership, others on
          independence, and some on social abilities and etc. Some frameworks
          are more narrow while others cover a larger range of SEL domains.{" "}

          2. Frameworks target different age groups and audiences
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          From kindergarten to adulthood, different SEL frameworks look at
          different behaviours commonly found in each age group.
        </div>
        <div className="h2">

          compare them

        <div className="p-main">
          Frameworks follow unique rubrics, lists, theories, and models. Some
          predicting the accomplishments of students that perform well on
          certain tasks, others evaluate the overall success of the school.

          How can we help researchers, educators, and policymakers better

          situation?

        <div className="label-secondary">Understanding the user</div>
        <div className="p-main">
          I generated 50 survey questions that ask educators how their current
          experience, their pain points, and the selection process on SEL
          frameworks. In the end, a written survey of 20 questions was given to
          educators, policymakers, and researchers in the field.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">Hereâ€™s what I learned from the survey:</div>
        <div className="h2">
          1. Target users are familiar with one or a few frameworks but thought
          more knowledge on SEL in general could benefit their work.

        <div className="h2">
          2. Users thought the most beneficial information would be framework
          comparison, followed by framework profile, followed by SEL
          terminology.

          Multiple SEL frameworks can have different or even conflicting

          display all definitions without confusing the user. I separated the
          definitions by its framework source without directly associating any
          framework to that specific term. Related terms and observable behavior
          are also listed separately for each framework.

          It's important to simplify complicated information. By communicating
          with researchers, developing user surveys, and assessing the objective
          of different framework comparison tools, I was able to highlight the
          unique significance of each comparison tool through visual design.
