          At MICA(Maryland Institute College of Art), there are plenty of clubs
          and activities that enable students to participate on-campus, find
          interests, and make friends. However, currently, it is difficult for
          students to find information about campus events and the motivation to
          participate.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          I designed a campus app that centralizes on-campus activities and

          Resources on the MICA website requires a lot of digging. The majority
          of the resources lives on MICA’s website, but student very rarely
          visits the school’s website.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          Information is very scattered. From emails to club fairs, it is
          difficult to track which clubs a student has joined, or where the
          meetings are.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          Resources and motivation decline as the semester progresses. During
          orientation and the first few weeks of the semester, students can
          learn about campus activities through club fairs, orientation leaders,
          and club in-class visits. During this time, students also have more
          free time to participate in clubs. However, towards the end of the
          semester, there are no engagement fairs and students are very busy
          with their school work.
        </div>
        <div className="label-secondary">Constraints</div>
        <div className="p-main">
          There are two types of meetings: regular weekly meetups and special
          events. Special events, such as showings, competitions, and outings
          are higher stake events where students outside of the club will also
          be interested in attending.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          Students have a multitude of digital platforms to communicate with
          each other. I didn’t design a messaging system because students
          already use social media, messaging apps, email, canvas to talk
          to each other remotely. Social media is especially a common tool
          students use, so integrating this experience with other digital
          platforms is key.

          Creating an event based experience

        <div className="p-main">
          During my interview process, I learned that students get caught up
          with their schedules and forget about student organizations. Many
          students also told me that they care more about the club activity than
          the overall theme of the club.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          With this in mind, I decided that the product should be inherently
          event based, similar to a calendar.

        <div className="p-main">
          The calendar highlights clubs that the student have followed. However,
          often times, a student not a part of a club would want to join a
          particular club meeting if their schedule allows or if they are
          interested. I also included additional events and meetings of the day
          that are worth attending.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          I separated the calendar into day view and month view. The day view
          can be used for learning the in-depth schedule of the day, and
          the month view can be used for learning about how various clubs fits
          into a student’s overall schedule.
        </div>
        <div className="p-main">
          I also explored a personalized messaging feature, where club owners
          can send custom messages to students regarding their upcoming club
          meeting. When talking to students, I also learned that many are more
          inclined to learn about the club from a member’s perspective.
